* Introduction
Experience the full spectrum of connection: Chatsphere - Where every exchange is a visual symphony.
Experience seamless connections with the most secure and reliable messaging platform.Use ChatSphere to start and join conversations.

This is my personal messaging project that allows people to communicate with each other with ease. They can share simple messages and even images during a conversation. It is a simple but complex project that propelled me to learn about Software Engineering.
* Getting Started
1. Visit the ChatSphere page
2. Create account or login Oaut or with your custom credentials

* Screenshots
* Technologies
+ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript
+ Backend: Flask - (create dynamic web pages by serving HTML templates using Jinja2, Handle Restful API requests, connect to DB, perform CRUD operations,
and implement authentication and authorization)
+ Storage: MySQL (version 5.7*) and Redis; the latter for caching. SQLAlchemy as the ORM of choice.
+ Authentication and authorization: Oauth2(google_auth_oauthlib, google.oauth2 libraries, etc.) and Flask sessions among others.
* API
The frontend communicates with the backend storage via a Flask API. Various endpoints have been configured to suite the needs of the project. 
** messages
A conversation can only be between two or more participants. As such, it would be best to group messages by a conversation such that two participants interact with each other through a Conversation object containing such participants and their messages.
