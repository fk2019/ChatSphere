# 2023 Christmas countdown

Anticipate the joy of christmas with an awesome countdown


<a id="org92010ab"></a>

# Introduction

Experience the magic of the season on our Christmas Countdown site,
featuring a mesmerizing animated timer, a jingling Christmas bell,
and a heartwarming 'Merry Christmas' message, promising a joyous
surprise when the festivities arrive.

I built the app inside my final [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) project directory to take advantage
of existing technologies especially access via HTTPS.
It is part of the ALX Holiday Challenge with an aim of having "fun,
learn, and celebrate the holiday season through creativs codng" - ALX.
