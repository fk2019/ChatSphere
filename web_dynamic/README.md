# Christmas Countdown Timer

Anticipate the joy of christmas with an awesome countdown


<a id="orgf7f1447"></a>

# Introduction

Experience the magic of the season on our Christmas Countdown site,
featuring a mesmerizing animated timer, a jingling Christmas bell,
and a heartwarming 'Merry Christmas' message, promising a joyous
surprise when the festivities arrive.

I built the app inside my final [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) project directory to take advantage
of existing technologies especially access via HTTPS.
It is part of the ALX Holiday Challenge with an aim of having "fun,
learn, and celebrate the holiday season through creativs codng" - ALX.

# Technologies

-   The frontend is built with HTML, css, and Javascript.
-   Backend contains a flask route that is also mirrored in a Nginx server that points to this route.
-   Site is served from an AWS EC2 instance through Haproxy on another instance. (Loved how ALX would allow us to spin up new servers from AWS and even destroy them during our foundations phase. So I decided to learn AWS cloud to host my projects.
